# Contributing to React Creates

Hey! Thanks for your interest in improving our Toolkit!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Submitting an Issue

Please provide us with an issue in case you've found a bug, want a new feature, have an awesome idea, or there is something you want to discuss.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

## Local Setup

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm i` in the yoshi monorepo root.

## Test

All packages most have tests. You can ran both from the root `npm test` or you can run each separately.
